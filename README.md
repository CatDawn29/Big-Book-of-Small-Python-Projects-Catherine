# Diving into Algorithms
 
 This is a book I bought to continue typing out code and also learn something new as well. 'Diving into Algorithms' gives me an code based introduction into algorithms and I will continue using Python. 

In this ipynb I will write many different type of algorithms, here are a few examples:
 - I will demostrate how to use algorithms for geometric applications
 - Demostrates how use algorithms to play games
 - Write code for algorithms to find different functions
